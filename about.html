            <h2>We are capable of doing anything we set our mind to</h2>
            <p>This is my situation: When I was about 14 years old, middle school, I thought I'd never be able to produce
                anything of substance when it came to coding

            <h2>Then I had an ultimatum with myself</h2>
            <h3>You either do it, charge head on towards the unknown</h3>
            <h4>Or suffer within the limits of your own ignorance and forever fear facing something unfamiliar</h4> <br>

            <h2>That's when I signed up for an introductory web design course at my school</h2>
            <h3>And there was where I learned about the magic of programming</h3>
            <h1><b>About Me</b></h1>
            <p>My name is <b>Marlan Pereira</b>, I'm <b>16 years old</b>, currently a <b>high school</b> student at EEEP Dr. Napole√£o Neves da Luz, 
                learning accounting as a major <b>and</b> taking basic programming lessons on the side.
            </p>
            <p>As you can see, I posess fluency in the english language and have an aspiration to learn as much as I can about various topics, unafraid to 
                take risks or be faced with a boatload of mistakes. Ironically, my wrongs tend to create more rights in the future, and I maintain a
                positive attitude all throughout the process of learning new skills.
            </p>
            <p>Most would argue that naming all your strengths at once can be appealing to an employer, but I'll just let this website speak for itself</p>
